# Pyspark-on-AWS-EMR---YELP-REVIEW-

ANALYSING 10 GB OF REVIEWS DATA FROM YELP

We provision a Spark cluster on AWS EMR, 
connect it to a Jupyter Notebook and then run a series of queries (in python with DataFrame API or Spark SQL) that answer a few simple questions about the Yelp Data available.

In doing so, we are demonstrating the ability to configure and provision infrastructure using the AWS Elastic Map Reduce ecosystem.

Also, demonstrating the understanding of how to leverage transformations and actions (as per the Spark terminology) with PySpark in performing basic data analysis tasks on information sources that are too large to manage in memory.
